Slicer is a modern, web-based Java reverse engineering tool focused on interactive bytecode inspection, navigation, and analysis directly in the browser. It aims to provide a serious alternative to traditional desktop tooling by combining Java-aware analysis features with a UX designed specifically for reverse engineering workflows.

The project is authored and maintained by **Matouš Kučera** and developed under the Katana Project organization.

I contributed multiple features and improvements to Slicer as an external contributor, primarily focused on Java-specific tooling, editor ergonomics, and workspace usability.

## Project Overview

Slicer is designed around the idea that Java reverse engineering workflows should be accessible, inspectable, and composable in a web environment. Instead of treating class files as opaque binaries, the tool exposes structure, relationships, and metadata through a pane-based workspace.

Key characteristics of Slicer include:

- Browser-based Java class inspection
- Tab and pane-driven analysis workflows
- Java-aware navigation and UI components
- Emphasis on usability for real reverse engineering tasks

The overall architecture and long-term direction of the project are led by its main developer.

## My Contributions

My contributions focused on improving how users explore, navigate, and manipulate Java artifacts inside the Slicer workspace. This includes both visible UX features and supporting infrastructure.

### Java Analysis Features

I implemented several Java-specific features to make class inspection more practical:

- A **Java class structure pane** exposing fields, methods, and inner classes — [PR #18](https://github.com/katana-project/slicer/pull/18)

- **Class-specific icons** for Java files in the file tree to improve visual scanning — [PR #17](https://github.com/katana-project/slicer/pull/17)

- **Type highlighting** when holding modifier keys, improving code navigation and readability — [PR #35](https://github.com/katana-project/slicer/pull/35)

### Mapping and Remapping (Exploratory)

I explored adding support for opening mapping files and performing class remapping as part of early deobfuscation workflows. This work was **experimental** and **not merged into the main project**, and therefore is not considered a Slicer feature.

- Experimental mapping and remapping support (not merged) — [PR #21](https://github.com/katana-project/slicer/pull/21)

The code is still published in [my fork](https://github.com/Dani-error/slicer/tree/feature/mapping-file).

### Workspace and Editor UX

Several contributions focused on improving the usability of the editor and workspace system:

- **Pinned tabs support** for persistent analysis views — PRs [#34](https://github.com/katana-project/slicer/pull/34), [#38](https://github.com/katana-project/slicer/pull/38), [#39](https://github.com/katana-project/slicer/pull/39)

- A **workspace summary view** for improved project context — [PR #37](https://github.com/katana-project/slicer/pull/37)

- Context menu actions for pane and editor management — PRs [#20](https://github.com/katana-project/slicer/pull/20), [#36](https://github.com/katana-project/slicer/pull/36), [#32](https://github.com/katana-project/slicer/pull/32)

- Support for opening files directly from external URLs — [PR #19](https://github.com/katana-project/slicer/pull/19)

### Localization

- Added **Spanish translations** to improve accessibility for Spanish-speaking users, contributing native-language localization support.

## Impact

These contributions improved Slicer’s suitability for real-world Java reverse engineering by:

- Making Java structure and metadata more accessible
- Reducing friction in multi-tab and multi-pane workflows
- Improving visual clarity and navigation efficiency
- Expanding accessibility through localization
