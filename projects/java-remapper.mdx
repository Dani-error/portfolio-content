Java Remapper is a JavaScript/TypeScript library for **remapping Java `.class` files using standard Java mapping formats**. While the public API is JS/TS, the actual remapping logic is implemented in Java and compiled to **WebAssembly via TeaVM**, allowing the same bytecode logic to run in Node.js and the browser without a JVM.

The library is intentionally low-level and designed to be used as a building block rather than a full end‑user tool.

## Features

### Mapping Support

- Supports common Java mapping formats:
  - SRG / XSRG
  - CSRG / TSRG (v1 & v2)
  - ProGuard
  - Tiny (v1 & v2)
- Automatic format detection based on file contents
- Unified internal representation via a `MappingSet`

### Class Remapping

- Remaps Java `.class` files from obfuscated to deobfuscated names
- Handles classes, fields, methods, and descriptors
- Output is a raw byte array, ready to be written or post-processed
- Works identically in Node.js and browser environments

## Usage

```ts
import { detectMappingFormat, parseMappings, remap } from "java-remapper";
import fs from "fs";

const mappingContent = fs.readFileSync("mappings.tiny", "utf8");
const format = detectMappingFormat(mappingContent)!;

const mappings = parseMappings(format, mappingContent);

const inputClass = fs.readFileSync("Example.class");
const outputClass = await remap(inputClass, mappings);

fs.writeFileSync("ExampleRemapped.class", outputClass);
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install java-remapper
```
